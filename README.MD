# Angular 2 Baby Unit Tests

Baby steps to unit testing an Angular 2 application.

It comes with an existing application and a battery of tests of that app.

1. You must have installed the global tool pre-requisites

	```bash
	npm install -g tsd typescript live-server
	```

1. install the project packages and typings files

	```bash
	npm install
	```

1. Open a terminal window and run the TypeScript compiler, watching for changes: `npm run tsc`

1. Open 2nd terminal window and launch the app in the browser `npm start`

1. For tests either browse to `src/unit-tests.html` or (if starting from scratch)
    `npm test`
